# Grocery-sales-prediction
## Problem statement:
To predict the sales of BIG MART GROCERY DATA test set, we have a training set with input features (different item properties and location of stores)\
Data reference: https://www.kaggle.com/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data \
We will analyse the data given, preprocessing and look into performances of various ML algorithms in prediction of BIG MART grocery sales.\
Observe performances of different ML algorithms 
- 'Linear Regression'
- 'Ridge Regression'
- 'Lasso Regression'
- 'Elastic Net Regression'
- 'SGD Regression'
- 'SVM'
- 'Decision Tree'
- 'Random Forest'
- 'Ada Boost'
- 'Bagging'
- 'Gradient Boost'
## Observation
We found out Gradient Boosting algorithm perform better with RMSE score of 1104.74 among all other we observed.
